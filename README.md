# Transfer-Learning

This repository demonstrates three approaches to using the VGG16 model for transfer learning:

1. Transfer Learning and Feature Extraction with Data Augmentation
2. Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning
3. Transfer Learning and Feature Extraction without Data Augmentation

## Prerequisites
. Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
